# Deep-Learning-of-Whale-Sounds

Wild animal identification from acoustic recording which mainly focuses on Deep Learning for Whale is very significant as there is only one unique solution is being build that triumphantly which discovers Whales in North Atlantic area. However, there is no such solution created to detect Whales in Antarctic area.

The sub-objective for undertaking this project is that if we are able to successfully construct an algorithm, it will give a perception and information about the species population, their distribution in different regions and about their behavior. 

Another motivation towards working on this project is that after receiving information on the species, it will help in conservation of wildlife especially which are endangered species.
